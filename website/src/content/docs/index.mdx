Bunshi (formerly known as `jotai-molecules`) was born out of the need to create lots of state atoms for jotai, but it evolved as a general dependency injection tool
for various state managers including [jotai](https://jotai.org/) atoms, [valtio](https://valtio.pmnd.rs/) proxies, [zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) stores,
[nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores), [vue refs](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/state-management.html#simple-state-management-with-reactivity-api) and
others. Stay tuned for how to use bunshi with your favorite state management library, form or RPC library.

> **Definition**: bunshi - ぶん‐し【分子】- Japanese for molecule
