## Installation

Bunshi is distributed on NPM as both a CommonJS and ES Module. It comes with type definitions for Typescript support.

```sh
npm i -D bunshi
```

## Create a Molecule

Molecules are the core building block of bunshi. They are functions that return a value.

```ts
import { molecule } from "bunshi";

export const ResizeMolecule = molecule(
  () => new ResizeObserver((e) => console.log("Resize", e))
);
```

> When this `ResizeMolecule` is used it will always return the same ResizeObserver. The value is memoized and cached.

## Use a Molecule

To use a molecule, pass it to `useMolecule` in your framework integration (React or Vue).

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="React">

```tsx
import { useMolecule } from "bunshi/react";
import { ResizeMolecule } from "../molecules";

export const Resized = () => {
  const observer = useMolecule(ResizeMolecule);
  return (
    <div ref={(el) => observer.observe(el)}>My size is being watched.</div>
  );
};
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Vue">

```vue
<script setup>
import { useMolecule } from "bunshi/vue";
import { ResizeMolecule } from "../molecules";

const observer = useMolecule(ResizeMolecule);

mounted(() => observer.observe(this.$el));
unmounted(() => observer.unobserve(this.$el));
</script>

<template>
  <div>My size is being watched.</div>
</template>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

An instance of `ResizeObserver` will be automatically created once and shared across the application in every call to `useMolecule`.

## Scope a Molecule

Molecules can also be [scoped](/concepts/scopes) instead of global. In the above example the `ResizeObserver` was shared globally across the app.
Instead, let's make each component have it's own resize observer. We can do this using the special `ComponentScope` that comes with Bunshi.

```ts
import { molecule, ComponentScope } from "bunshi";

export const ResizeMolecule = molecule((mol, scope) => {
  scope(ComponentScope);
  return new ResizeObserver((e) => console.log("Resize", e));
});
```

Scoping is declarative. By calling `scope(ComponentScope)` the molecule will automatically be scoped.

## Use a custom scope

Sometimes state needs to be shared, but not globally, and not per-component. It needs to exists somewhere in the middle. Bunshi supports creating custom scopes.
There are a lot of use cases for [scopes](/concepts/scopes) for sharing data across pages, sections, forms, or even rows or columns in a table.

```ts
import { molecule, createScope } from "bunshi";

export const FormScope = createScope("none");

export const ResizeMolecule = molecule((mol, scope) => {
  scope(FormScope);
  return new ResizeObserver((e) => console.log("Resize", e));
});
```

## Provide a custom scope

Custom scopes need to be provided using the framework-specific API. Bunshi comes with integrations into React and Vue to provide scope implicitly.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="React">

```tsx
import { ScopeProvider } from "bunshi/react";
import { FormScope } from "../molecules";

export const Form = ({ name, children }) => {
  return (
    <form>
      Form {name}
      <ScopeProvider scope={FormScope} value={name}>
        {children}
      </ScopeProvider>
    </form>
  );
};
```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Vue">

```vue
<script setup>
import { provideScope } from "bunshi/vue";
import { FormScope } from "../molecules";

const {name} = defineProps(['name'])

provideScope([FormScope,name])

</script>

<template>
  <form>
    Form: {{name}}
    <slot></slot>
  <form>
</template>

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example everything inside of the `<Form>` component will be share a `ResizeObserver`, it won't be unique per component
or shared across the entire application.

## Conclusion - Decoupled and Lazy

The code that you wrote is decoupled and lazy.

- **Decoupled**: You can refactor the `ResizeMolecule` without affecting the thing that depend on it.
- **Lazy**: A resize observer is only created lazily when it's needed. It's not eagerly created and sitting around in a variable.

When your write code with molecules, you can pull state up or push state down, without having to refactor your components.

We completed an example of scoping the `ResizeObserver` to be global, scoped to a component, or shared inside of a form.
