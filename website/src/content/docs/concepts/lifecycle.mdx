Molecules are used to create values. Those values are created as needed depending on the application, scope, and injectors. They
can be mounted to signal they are in use, unmounted when they are no longer in use, and then finally cleaned up in garbage collection.

## Example

<LifecycleExample />

In this example the lifecycle events are logged to the [Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console). Try clicking to
toggle the Counter component to be mounted and unmounted. You should notice a few things:

* There are 2 counters, but lifecycle events are only fired once because the molecule is shared.
* The lifecycle events always follow the same order.

In React Strict Mode there are additional calls to lifecycle events:

* Molecules are mounted, unmounted and then immediately re-mounted.
* The final unmount only happens once.
* Only one value is created and shared across components. This isn't true for all molecules. Non-default scopes will have more than one value created and disposed of.

## Created

Bunshi tries to create molecule values as lazily as possible, and to make sure that any value it creates can be garbage collected.

* If a value already exists for a molecule (and relevant scopes), then that value will be used instead of creating a new value.
* If a value doesn't already exist, then a new one will be created.


## Mounted

Molecule values aren't fully cached until a subscription is started. This is handled automatically behind the scenes in `useMolecule` for
both React and Vue. In Vanilla JS this is handled in `MoleculeInjector.use` and `MoleculeInjector.useLazily`.

### use vs useLazily

If you are using a MoleculeInjector directly, there are two keys methods:

* `MoleculeInjector.use` will create a new value and mount it immediately. It also returns a value to clean up the subscription later.
* `MoleculeInjector.useLazily` will create a new value, but won't mount it immediately. This can be done later, and a value can be mounted, unmounted, and then mounted again.

To support React strict mode, `useLazily` is used internally.

## Unmounted

Molecule values will be unmounted when nothing is using them anymore. This happens automatically in `useMolecule` for
both React and Vue. In Vanilla JS this is handled when the stop method is called on everything using a molecule.

Note:
* An unmounted value may be re-mounted, especially in React Strict Mode.
* If a value has been mounted, it will always be unmounted when everything stops using it.
* Vanilla JS users should be careful to avoid memory leaks by always stopping any subscription they start.

## React Strict mode

React strict mode re-runs your React hooks to make sure that they are following best practices. Bunshi makes working with React strict mode easier.
It helps avoid some of the challenges of working with `useMemo` and `useEffect`, but the constraints of Strict Mode does still have an effect
on your molecules.

There are a couple things to be aware of:
* Your molecule values may be re-mounted. `onMount` may be called again after `onUnmount` has been called.
* Lifecycles methods will be called in order, so `onMount` then `onUnmount` then again `onMount`, and so on.
* Your molecule values may NEVER be mounted. Strict mode may dispose of a value before calling `onMount`.
* In strict mode your molecule may be called twice:
  * one value thrown away (in the first render)
  * the other value `onMount` then `onUnmount` then again `onMount` (in the second render)

**The core premise of Bunshi still applies.** If a molecule is being used by another component then that value is used. These notes about strict mode only
apply to newly created values. Existing values are shared without un-necessary lifecycle calls.


### Framework Recommendations

Some state frameworks come with built-in utilities to help with creating and cleaning up stateful connections. Others
leave this up to you to figure out when you want to start or stop subscriptions.

Bunshi's goal is to be a thin layer on top of other libraries. We don't want to get in your way. So if your library
has a built-in lifecycle or cleanup tool for easily using them in `React` and `Vue`, hen use those. Otherwise,
use `onMount` and `onUnmount` from Bunshi.
